Hi, my name is Faith Faumuina, my online name for anything is normally Phaythie though.
I'm interested in video games from how they function to how the developers designed them.
I'm currently learning HTML on freecodecamp, and I took a coding class in college so I know a little bit of C++.
I'm looking to collaborate on any projects I can help with. currently I know that I don't have much knowledge, but the more problems I solve, and the more practice I have, the better.
You can reach me either on here, or through my email: faithfaumuina14@gmail.com
My pronouns are she/her.
Fun fact so far: Ever played Dave the diver? just started and it's amazing.
